# Elm Array Runtime Error Demonstration

We have two different Array implementations that can try to shuffle a poker deck any number of times. The Core implementation fails if you ask it to shuffle more than once. The Hamt implementation does just fine.

To try this out, execute `run.sh` from the command line.

It will just run `elm-test` and tell you to modify a file to change what you're testing.
